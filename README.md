## Description

Developers need to have a high-quality README file for their projects on GitHub.
This file includes information related to the app, what it is for, how to use, hot to install, how to report issues, and how to make contributions.
The user can quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one. This allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project.

This application utilizes Node js, and it is invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node ./develop/index.js
```
